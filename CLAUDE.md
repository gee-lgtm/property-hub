- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses across all endpoints
- **Performance**: Server-side filtering and querying for optimal performance

### Development Best Practices
- All components built with mobile-first approach
- Prisma-generated types replace manual TypeScript interfaces
- Component structure supports easy feature additions
- Responsive design patterns consistent throughout
- Touch interactions optimized for mobile devices
- Proper separation of client/server concerns

## Testing & Validation
- ✅ Build process: Successful compilation
- ✅ Database: Schema validation and seeding working
